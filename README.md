# Weather Dashboard

# The weather dashboard works using the OpenWeather API to retreive weather data at the user's request. The API returns third party data such as city temperature, wind, and heat index for whichever city the user chooses. The user's previously visited cities are stored in local storage and show on the left side column. The user may click on the city previously earched to re-view weather data for that particular city.
